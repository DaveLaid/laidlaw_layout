Mavi Laidlaw Bio

Hi I'm Mavi ~ I am a designer, a web, graphic and user experience designer to be exact. What I do is I  make really pretty websites and make them functional for the user. My education background is as follows: I have a Bachelors of Arts Degree in Music with an emphasis in Business as well as a minor in Marketing from Cal Poly Pomona. I also have an Associates of Arts Degree as a Website Software Specialist. I'm currently working towards my next Associates Degree from Santa Monica College as a Graphic Designer. A lot of what I've learned has been self taught and I'm happy to say has worked in advancing me this far in the web design world. I'm currently an Independent Web/Graphic/UX Designer and I am working in conjunction with my husband the other half of Laidlaw Layout. Together we make an unstoppable team.
